A bit about me:
I am a 18 year old student at my local college in the UK, studying IT. In my free time, I run a college group, focused on cybersecurity and have placed  3rd in the UK WorldSkills CyberSecurity Competition

I also partake in other CTF events with Various Groups, and often place within the top 15% at a minimum. Over my time as a competitor I have learned a large amount, one such example is within the 2023 cyber apocolypse ran by Hackthebox, is when I personally developed and successfully executed a buffer overflow script to obtain remote code execution.
